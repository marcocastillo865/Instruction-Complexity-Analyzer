If they refuse to give you a copy for any reason, you can file a Freedom of Information Act request. To do this, download form G-639 from the Department of Homeland Security website. Fill in the form and send it to the address provided. Generally it can take USCIS a month to process your request. However, if you need to speed up the process, for removal proceedings for example, include a letter explaining that you need it expedited and why.
