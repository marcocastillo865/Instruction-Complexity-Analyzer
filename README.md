## Instruction Complexity Analyzer

### Summary and Importance:
Executive functions are the cognitive skills that help us plan, focus, and manage tasks. A significant challenge for individuals with conditions like ADHD or cognitive fog is "task initiation," where gauging the mental energy required for a task can be overwhelming. Not knowing if a set of instructions will be simple or complex can be a major barrier to starting.

This project aims to address this by creating an AI-powered "Instruction Complexity Analyzer." This tool will act as a preparatory aid, allowing users to assess a task's difficulty before committing to it. By providing a predicted "complexity score," the tool will help users manage their time and energy, set realistic expectations, and approach new tasks with more confidence.

### Research Question:
Can a supervised regression model be trained on engineered linguistic and structural features from instructional texts to accurately predict a "complexity score," providing a tool to help users with executive function challenges assess a task's difficulty?

### Dataset of Interest
Our primary dataset will be the [wikiHow Raw Data dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniketsharma00411/wikihow-raw-data/data).
